1.  Evolution of software development

The waterfall aproaach -  1953
V model 
The spiral model approach -1990
Iterative and incremental software process- 1996-1998
Agile resolution  - 2001      
and then in 2004 devops was introduced.


2. How facebook uses Devops ?

Continous update of the application within 2-3 weeks.
Facebook accomplishes this through a code ownership model that makes its developers responsible--that includes testing and supporting through production and delivery--for each kernel of code they write and update. Itâ€™s through policies like these that Facebook has developed a DevOps culture


3.What is Devops?

It is culture.
Combination of development and Testing + operations team.
Devops is union of people proccess and product that enables continous delivery of value to end customers.




4. What are the different Devops tools ?


1.	Git	Code, Build
2.	Gradle	Build
3.	Selenium	Test
4.	Jenkins	Build, Test, Deploy
5.	Puppet	Deploy, Operate
6.	Chef	Deploy, Operate
7.	Docker	Build, Deploy, Operate


what is difference between waterfall and agile and devops.
ans 

watefall model : Requirement is fixed.
                 cannot moved back to previous stage.
                 Change cannot be made at any stage.
                 If one team is working the other team is idle .
                 No collorabation .

Agile Model : Requirement is not fixed.
              provides flexibility
              small team units can be siloed in agile .
         

Devops : Requirement is not fixed .
         Customer can make changes at any point.
         there is a collabration among team.
         if one team is belongs to production and one belong to testing both are working together.
         Large team can be siloed in devops.





What are the six phases and what are the outcomes of the the phases.
1.Requirement gathering and analysis 
2.Design.
3.Devlopment
4.Testing
5.Deployment
6.Maintainence

1.Requirement gathering : 
All the relevant information is collected from the customerto develop a product as per their expectation.
Business analyst and Project Manager set up a meeting with the customer to gather all the information.
what the customer wants to build, who will be the end-user, what is the purpose of the product.
SRS documentation is created.

2.Design and analaysis
The requirement gathered in the SRS document is used as an input and software architecture that is used for implementing system development is derived.
Blueprint is created.

output : Architectural plan , database design, screen design, module desigin, program specifiaction.

3.Development 
The actual coding takes place and source code is written in this phase.
All the components of the software are implemented in this phase.

Outputs.
Source code 
Unit level testing report.


4.Testing 
The product is tested before it is launched.
Testing starts once the coding is complete and the modules are released for testing. 
Ihe developed software is tested thoroughly and any defects found are assigned to developers to get them fixed.
Functional and non functional testing takes places.


Output:

Test scenario document.
Test case design of document.
Test script : used in selenium.
Defect report.
Test execution report. how many test cases executed ?





5.Deployment
First UAT is performed that is user acceptance test.
If the customer finds the application as expected, then sign off is provided by the customer to go live.
Then the product is launched into the market.


output:

user manual
release notes


6.Maintainence
After the deployment of a product on the production environment maintenance of the product 
if any issue comes up and needs to be fixed or any enhancement is to be done is taken care by the developers.

output:

change request
code change





What is epic , user stories , error , bugs,fault : i.e AGILE TERMNILOGY

Epic: It defines the major functionality of application or large body of work



user stories : Smaller piece of requirement/application.
               derieved from Epic.
               

error: Mistakes caused by humans.
       An Error is a mistake made in the code; that's why we cannot execute or compile code.
       Raised by Automation and test engineers.
	

Bugs/defect:  A programming error that causes a program to work poorly, produce incorrect results or crash.
       deviation between actual and expected result.
       ISTQB (INTERNATIONAL STANDARD TESTING QUALITY BAORD )

Fault : 



Advantages and disadavantges of devops

Advantages of Devops.
Faster product release and faster time to market
Higher productivity
Process efficiency
Shortened production cycles
Better operational support
Engaged and motivated staff
Better Customer experience management
Clear product vision within the team
Increased deployment success rates
Increased product quality
Better team efficiency


Disadvanatge of devops

Demands proper mindset across the company
Lowered business security by outsourcing the DevOps operations
Dealing with the legacy system is a challenge
Practicing security for CI/CD is a separate affair
Getting the right pool of DevOps expertise is a challenge
Challenges with the number of tools and switching tools
Transition challenges (organizational and technical)



Deleveriables outcomes.


V MODEL
.
1.Requirement analysis : --------- USER ACCEPTANCE TEST .... BRS , user requrement document
2.S/W SPECIFICATION  --------------SYSTEM TESTING      ..... SRS,System testing documet. 
3.HIGH LEVEL DESIGN     ------    INTEGRATION TESTING  ....  HIGHLEVEL DESIGN DOCUMENT,Integration testing document.
4.LOW LEVEL/DETAILED DESIGIN ----  UNIT TESTING        .....  LOW LEVEL DESIGN DOCUMENT, UNIT TESTING REPORT.
5.Coding                                                .... Source Code

levels of testing associated with V MODEL :
1.UAT : USER Acceptance testing. 
2.SYSTEM TESTING
3.INTEGRATION TESTING
4.UNIT TESTING

USER ACCEPTANCE TEST --- apha : Testing done in development phase.
                         beta: Real time evnvoriment testing.


AGILE MODEL 
concept : scope document,BRS document
Inception: finalised, project Architectural plan, user interface plan.
Iterations/coding: Working code, unit testing 
depolyment : user manual,product version,realse notes
maintainence : change request, code change



waterfall model
1.Requirement :gathering and analysis: SRS documentation is created.
2.Design.     : Architectural plan , database design, screen design, module desigin, program specifiaction.
3.Devlopment  : Source code,  Unit level testing report. 
4.Testing     : Test scenario document,Test case design of document,Test script : used in selenium,Defect report.
Test execution report.
5.Deployment  : user manual, release notes
6.Maintainence: change request, code change

standards : we dont have to change the rights in that.

lean : main motive is they want less input and more output
       adds value to the customer
       cutomer priority is highest priority.
